DNS NSLOOKUP Batch Script

This script will prompt the user to enter a domain name, and then it will run the two nslookup commands using the domain name as the input. It will then loop back to the start and prompt the user to enter another domain name.

To run this script, save it as a .bat file and then double-click the file to execute it. Alternatively, you can open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and then run it by typing filename.bat, where filename is the name of the script.
